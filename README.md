# CARBON GRID
A simple, lightweight, responsive CSS grid system built on flexbox.

Carbon Grid was inspired by some of the most popular grid systems, but built to be lightweight and simple to use. In other words, for less than 5kb (unzipped) you get a CSS grid system that can hanlde almost any layout and takes about 5 minutes to learn.

Note: Carbon Grid is built on flexbox which is a relatively new addition to CSS, so make sure you check the browser support before using. Also, flexbox is awesome and can to a lot, but this system is designed to address the most common layout issues. If you need very specific flex features it's very easy to expand on the base styles.

### Getting Started
