# CARBON GRID
**A simple, lightweight, responsive CSS grid system built on flexbox.**

Carbon Grid was inspired by some of the most popular grid systems, but built to be lightweight and simple to use. In other words, for less than 5kb (unzipped) you get a CSS grid system that can hanlde almost any layout and takes about 5 minutes to learn.

### Getting Started

Intro: Carbon Grid uses flexbox which is awesome and can do a lot, but this system is designed to only address the most common layout issues. If you need very specific flex features it's very easy to expand on the base styles. Flexbox is a relatively new addition to CSS, so make sure you check the browser support before using. It's been tested back to IE 9 and seems to work well.
